Google Query is like a magical treasure chest for numbers and words.

-- What does it do?
- It helps you find answers to tricky questions about data.
- You tell it what you want, and it digs through piles of information to find just the right stuff.
- It's like having a super-smart detective friend who knows where to look!
- Google Query is like a secret code that unlocks hidden knowledge.
